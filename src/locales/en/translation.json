  "about_news": "I have been an <strong>assistant professor</strong> at both the <strong>Information Media Center and Graduate School of Advanced Science and Engineering, Hiroshima University </strong>, since April 2024. I am open to academic and industrial collaborations. Please feel free to contact me if you have any interest.",
  "about_academia": "I am passionate about constructing <strong>provably correct systems</strong> by discovering theories <strong>from practice</strong> and developing methodologies <strong>for practice</strong>. My primary focus centers around the <strong>security and privacy</strong> aspects of <strong>software engineering</strong>, particularly <strong>decentralized systems</strong> spanning protocol and application levels. Currently, I am constructing <strong>transition-oriented programming</strong>, a new programming paradigm to facilitate developing provably correct systems.",
  "about_industry": "Meanwhile, I am a <strong>system architect</strong> certified by the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean governments. I have directed dozens of development projects for startups and institutes since 2015. Besides, I am actively exploring the best current practice of developing robust, secure, and efficient systems with minimum cost.",
